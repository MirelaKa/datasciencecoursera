##Exploratory Data Analysis
##Project Assignment 1

##Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Our task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system. Data are loaded from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets.

## Dataset used is Electric power consumption [20Mb]

## Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. 

## We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.

##There are four different plots given as png files, and four R files attached, containing the code that plots are based on.
